            <p className='about__text'>I am a Brainstation Full Stack Developer graduate that is never finished expanding their knowledge about software development.
Starting out at a young age, technology always had my interests. As a kid I would surf the web to play browser games, watch YouTube video, chat with 
friends on social media or do research for school. There was so much to do and knowing people made these websites themselves for us to use sparked an interest in me.
I embarked on a journey to build and design applications that preform well and that will leave a mark on the world wide web that inspire others just like me to get
 into web development and learn how technology works.</p>
